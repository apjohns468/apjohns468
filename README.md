- 👋 Hi, I’m @apjohns468
- 👀 I’m interested in switching my career to tech, up-cycling and thrifting, yoga, and martial arts.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning learning to code, how to do martial arts, how to do the splits, and sewing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that would be perfect for beginner coders.
